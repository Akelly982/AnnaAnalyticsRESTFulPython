"""Following is a simple webserver, taken from Flask's documentaion
"""

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')

"""Save the above snippet in a file called ``app.py`` and you can now run a
Flask development server by typing:

#CMD   FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_APP=app.py flask run   //!!!!you dont need to worry about this...

Local:
#CMD set FLASK_APP=hello    <-- if you are using a .py file you dont need this          //!!!!you dont need to worry about this...
#CMD set FLASK_APP=         <--- if you need to empty it                                //!!!!you dont need to worry about this...

//start local hosting
#CMD  flask run

//install sklearn for linear regression
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

//requires python
    //#CMD python --version


// potential conflicts
Note that in order to avoid potential conflicts with other packages it is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment (venv) or a conda environment.

// The above venv was installed when setting up our flask environment




//install scikit / sklearn
    // (venv) C:\Users\XxXxXx\xXXxxXXxx\repo\AnnaAnalyticsRESTFulPython>  <-- you need to lauch the virtural environment venv then run the CMD
    // otherwise it just installs to you machine as a whole
    // To get this to happen I lauched flask and opened a new command line within VSCode

CMD# pip install -U scikit-learn

//AKNote when ran installs below packages    (notice joblib)
    //threadpoolctl, scipy, joblib, scikit-learn

//to check installation of scikit went correctly
CMD#      python -m pip show scikit-learn         # to see which version and where scikit-learn is installed
CMD#      python -m pip freeze                    # to see all packages installed in the active virtualenv
CMD#      python -c "import sklearn; sklearn.show_versions()"
